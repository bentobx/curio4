        <h1>The King in Yellow</h1>
        <p>In the year 1895, one Robert W. Chambers inked a collection of short stories known commonly as The King in Yellow. We, as you, believed them to be distinctly within the realm of fiction.</p>
        <p>We, as you, <em>were wrong</em>.</p>

        <p>My hands were trembling when I received the crate, I was so excited and trepidatious…!</p>

      <p>Our research into the source of this delivery weaves a strange and unexpected tale, one that we are prepared to offer to you in the spirit of friendship and mercantilism. The narrative reaches deeply into the works of Mr. Chambers and those with whom he associated, and sheds some light upon a single performance of a play that, quite literally, brought the house down. There are consequences to learning of these events, consequences that might lead you to question if what you see could possibly be real, and others to wonder if your sanity is beginning to wane.</p>

      <p>Despite measures taken, the inscrutable legion has been relentless in leaving these effigies in our warehouse. As such, we shall continue to share The King in Yellow for as long as the supply of artifacts remains unceasing. Perhaps, with your assistance, we may one day be absolved of this responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>The King in Yellow is a unique experience comprised of three mailings, including two dramatic artifacts of great potency and import sealed safely within one of our hand-made wooden crates. Rounding our the experience are numerous weathered and aged background materials, documentation, and esoteric discoveries, providing knowledge of the Yellow King, his acolytes, and the writings surrounding them.
      </p>
      <p><em>Please, do not be alarmed when a heavy crate thrumming with arcane gravity arrives ominously upon your doorstep!</em>

            <p>The adventure begins with an old, water damaged, but personalized letter from the dead letter office, containing some oblique references to censored art. There are also several pages from the play The King in Yellow, including a page from the long-lost Act II. This all arrives contained within a modern envelope, but without information on the sender.</p>

            <p>A beautiful, letter-pressed and debossed playbill of the only known live performance of the play "The King in Yellow," dated from 1895. A newspaper article, outlining mysterious figures outside a prestigious theatre, accompanies a jauntily wrapped necklace, adorned with The Yellow Sign. While suitable for wearing, we cannot be responsible for the actions of those adorned with this symbol of great power and control.
